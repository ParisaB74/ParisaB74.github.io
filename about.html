      <h1>About Us</h1>
      <p><strong>Secure Grants Pro</strong> helps non-profit organizations and community groups access public funding through clear, compelling, and professional grant applications. We handle every step — from defining your project idea to crafting detailed proposals and reports.</p>

      <h2>Our Mission</h2>
      <p>We empower organizations that make a difference by simplifying the funding process and helping them grow stronger, more inclusive communities.</p>

      <h2>What Makes Us Different</h2>
      <p>We take the stress out of grant applications. Our team manages the process from start to finish — ensuring your proposal aligns with funder priorities and stands out for its clarity, impact, and vision.</p>

      <h2>Our Story</h2>
      <p>After years of collaborating with community organizations, we saw many great ideas go unfunded simply because of complex applications. <strong>Secure Grants Pro</strong> was founded to change that — making grant writing accessible, efficient, and empowering.</p>

      <h2>Our Values</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Integrity</strong> — We operate transparently and ethically in every project.</li>
        <li><strong>Collaboration</strong> — We partner closely with clients to understand their mission.</li>
        <li><strong>Empowerment</strong> — We help communities strengthen their capacity for growth.</li>
        <li><strong>Inclusion</strong> — We believe every good idea deserves the chance to be funded.</li>
      </ul>
